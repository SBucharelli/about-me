## About Me
My name is Stephanie Bucharelli. I'm a research analyst for a company in Sutton. I want to move on from data entry at my current job. I'd like to get into a career that I can be proud of and advance in over time. I have a two year old daugther that I want to teach that you can achieve things if you try.

## Career Update
I completed the WSU/Stack Education Coding Bootcamp and received an amazing opportuinity within my company to become a Software Developer. I am truly so excited to be on this new journey.

## For Fun 
My daughter keeps me busy, but when I have downtime, I enjoy playing video games/board games. I like to watch E-Sports and Beatboxing competitions online. I also recently got into painting which is quite relaxing. We go for walks on trails nearby and I used to rock climb a bit prior to having my daughter.

## Technical Skills
Took a certificate course in R and briefly saw HTML in an online video, but I don't have any real experience. I use Excel for work sometimes.
